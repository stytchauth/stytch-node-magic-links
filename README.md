# stytch-node-magic-links

This example app uses the [Stytch API](https://stytch.com/docs/api) and backend Node SDK to demonstrate a quick Stytch implementation using our [Email Magic Links](https://stytch.com/docs/guides/magic-links/email-magic-links/api) product.

# Running locally

## Set up

### In the Stytch Dashboard
1. Create a [Stytch](https://stytch.com/) account. Once your account is set up a Project called "My first project" will be automatically created for you.

2. Navigate to [Redirect URLs](https://stytch.com/dashboard/redirect-urls), and add `http://localhost:3000/authenticate` (the `PORT` set in `.env`) as the types **Login** and **Sign-up**.

3. Finally, navigate to [API Keys](https://stytch.com/dashboard/api-keys), and copy your `project_id` and `secret`. You will need these value later on.

### On your machine

In your terminal, clone the project and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/stytchauth/stytch-node-magic-links.git
cd stytch-node-magic-links
npm i
```

Next, fill in `STYTCH_PROJECT_ID` and `STYTCH_SECRET` in the `.env` file with the credentials retrieved in step 3 above. 

## Running the app

After completing all the set up steps above the application can be run with the command:

```npm start```

The application will be available at [`http://localhost:3000`](http://localhost:3000) and you'll be able to login with Email Magic Links! 

To do so, enter your email, then check for the Stytch email and click the sign in button.

## Next steps

This example app showcases a small portion of what you can accomplish with Stytch. Here are a few ideas to explore:

1. Add additional login methods like [Passwords](https://stytch.com/docs/guides/passwords/api) or [Passcodes](https://stytch.com/docs/guides/passcodes/api).
2. Use [Stytch Sessions](https://stytch.com/docs/sessions) to secure your backend.
3. Secure your app further by building MFA authentication using methods like [WebAuthn](https://stytch.com/docs/guides/webauthn/api).
